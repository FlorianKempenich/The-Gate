# The Gate
### Https Front-end Proxy with Nginx & Docker

## Simple, secure, configurable

**The Gate** is a _quick to deploy_ entry gate for your server.

It provides a **single `HTTPS` endpoint that redirects to your services.**  
All you have to do is configure the **Redirection rules**.



Securely serve multiple services from one single entrypoint: **The Gate**

![Test](https://gitlab.com/the_blog/nginx-root-feproxy/raw/master/temp/the_gate.jpg)

### No complex setup

- Just `up` and all your services are securely available.
- All the configuration is dynamically loaded, **no restart needed.**

### All services are served via `HTTPS`

- All `HTTP` connections are redirected to `HTTPS`
- Provide the certificates and they'll be loaded automatically
-    No certificates but would like to `up` **The Gate**?  
     No problem, **The Gate** generates its own self-signed certificates in case it can not find yours.  
     Your certificates will be loaded the moment they are available
-    No idea how to provide certificates?  
     [The Gate: Certificate Daemon](http://putlink.com) does that for you ;)
      
### Use your own rules

- Want to serve one service per domain? No problems!
- Want to serve different services depending on the url path? No problem!
- Be creative...

### The Gate helps with your certificate challenges

- It serves a static directory under `www.yourdomain.com/.well-knows/`
- No setup, just `up` and that directory is served.

## PUT PICTURE (or here)



## Usage

> ## TODO:
> It would be nice to have the `up` being a single script. Like we could get it through `wget`
> The script would install `thegate`, and then:
> 
> - `thegate up` 
> - `thegate down` 
> 
> Provide of course un-install script.
> When doing `thegate up` we would check that the required config directory structure is present.

> ## TIP:
> When doing part on the `Letsencrypt` exemple.
> Simply copy paste the result of the `tree` command in a code block. Works wonderfully :)


### Requirements

**The Gate** only needs **4 things**, for the magic to happen:

- **Certificate directory**
- **Certificate & PrivKey file names**
- **Configuration directory:** Where to find `services.conf`
- **Webroot directory:** From where to serve static content.

#### Certificate directory & Certificate/PrivKey file names
Describe what it is
WRITE Special `symlink` case.
REFER TO: `Letsencrypt` example
#### Configuration directory: Where to find `services.conf`
Explain quicky and REFER to dedicated part

#### Webroot directory: From where to serve static content.
Describe quickly
And explain how it works in term of "what path the directory actually serves"
--> Remember that we can not serve the `root` directly under well known, because that is not expected by let's encrypt
The basic explanation is:

Everything under `YOUR_STATIC_DIRECTORY/.well-known/` will be served under `http://www.yourdomain.com/.well-knows/`
--> Port 80, no https for this one.




### Services configuration

The main configuration of your services is in the `services.conf` file.

**This file defines:**

* All the **Services** served by `The Gate`
* The **Rules** on how to serve them

The syntax is the same as a regular `nginx` configuration file.
But only the services are defined here.
This file will then be included in the General `nginx` file.

**Each service needs to include `services.base.conf`**

    server {
        include services.base.conf;

        // REST OF THE CONFIGURATION
    }

`services.base.conf` already includes everything needed for a `https` connection.

    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate PATH_TO_CERTIFICATES/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key PATH_TO_CERTIFICATES/privkey.pem;

### Examples
#### Service:

    server {
        include services.base.conf;
        server_name professionalbeginner.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2000;
        }
    }

#### Complete configuration
An example of a working `services.conf` is available in the repository.

# Nginx as a Front-End Proxy

This project offers a out of the box pre-configured `nginx` server running in a docker image.
Simply customise the `nginx.conf` to redirect to the correct services


## Usage
- Customise the `nginx.conf`
- Run `docker-compose up --build -d`

To stop the `nginx`: `docker-compose down`

## Make explicit that this is specifically targeted for 1 use case:
### Certificates Generated by `Letsencrypt`
### One certificate for all domains served by this `nginx`

## Use HTTPS

It is possible and very simple to use `HTTPS` thanks to this project:
- [Certificate generation project](https://gitlab.com/the_blog/letsencrypt-docker-daemon)

### Initial setup
As explained in the `README.md` of the [certificate generation project](https://gitlab.com/the_blog/letsencrypt-docker-daemon).
We need to serve static content.

**To do so:**
- Create a directory.
  - For example in `/https/webroot`
- Serve this directory under `DOMAIN/.well-known/`
  - In the `nginx.conf`:
  ```
    ## SSL Security #####################################
    server {
        listen 80;

        # Serve static content (for the certificate challenge)
        location /.well-known/ {
            root /https/webroot/;
        }
    }
    ## END - SSL Security ###############################
  ```

### Generate the certificate & auto-renew
Follow the instructions on the [certificate generation project](https://gitlab.com/the_blog/letsencrypt-docker-daemon).
